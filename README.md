**Abstract**

Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) is a situation that our reefs have a hard time coming back from, especially the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). COTS preys upon Stoney or hard coral polyps. Being one of the largest starfish in the world, this starfish can eat through the GBR quickly if we donâ€™t control the outbreaks.

The goal is to quickly identify starfish accurately by building an object detection model that will be trained on underwater videos of coral reefs. This can help researchers and scientists help control COTS outbreaks within the Great Barrier Reef.

**Introduction**

The Crown of Thorns Starfish is a giant starfish that preays upon stoney or hard coral polyps. The name is earned by its thorn-like spines which are venomous--covering its upper surface that resembles a lot like the bibical croun of thorns.  Why is it a problem to the Great Barrier Reef? Even though the benefit of the COT Starfish helps keep the growth of fast-growing coral species down, leaving space for other slow-growing coral to grow, this starfish multiplies quickly in population.  The Crown of Thorns Starfish also eats coral tissue quicker than it the coral can grow back, causing devastation by COTS pushing an outbreak.  WIth the cause of COTS outbreaks to be unknown, scientist agree that perhaps the increase levels of nutrients in the ocean due to agriculture runoff or oceans becoming increasingly warmer, thismay lead to a plankton bloom, an important and necessary food source for starfish larvae.

Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) devastate the coral reef through outbreaks, epsecially when the starfish is ravenous in nature that can wipe out nearlly the entire living corals in the area.  COTS are one of the largest starfish species known, pushing 25-35cm in diameter and gorwing to a size of 80cm, making training the dataset easy as The Crown of Thorns Starfish easy to see and spot among the reef.

**Abstract**

Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) is a situation that our reefs have a hard time coming back from, especially the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). COTS preys upon Stoney or hard coral polyps. Being one of the largest starfish in the world, this starfish can eat through the GBR quickly if we donâ€™t control the outbreaks.
The goal is to quickly identify starfish accurately by building an object detection model that will be trained on underwater videos of coral reefs. This can help researchers and scientists help control COTS outbreaks within the Great Barrier Reef.
